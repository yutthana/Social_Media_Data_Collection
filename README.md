# Social_Media_Data_Collection
we are interested in how social media, such as facebook, twitter, or linkedin, could improve the effects of company’s R&D on the sales growth. We attempt to investigate and analyze the data based on approximately 6,000 public companies in US stock market, to find the evidence supporting the benefits of social media for public firms. My main contribution in this project is to retrieve social media data from company’s websites.

#Files
1. `Collect_twitter_url.py` - python file which use to crawl twitter url from list of company websites.
2. `firm_data_URL.csv` - list of company. (already filled with twitter, facebook, linkedin, and youtube url)
